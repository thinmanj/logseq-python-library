ðŸš€ **Excited to announce logseq-python 1.0.0a2 is now live on PyPI!**

I'm thrilled to share the most comprehensive Python library for Logseq knowledge graphs - now production-ready and available for immediate installation.

## What makes this special?

ðŸ”§ **Just Fixed**: Critical import issues resolved - the package now works flawlessly from PyPI installation
ðŸ“Š **Complete Task Management**: Full support for TODO states, priorities (A/B/C), deadlines, and workflow analytics  
ðŸ§  **AI-Powered Analysis**: 4 advanced analyzers for sentiment, topics, summaries, and content structure
ðŸ”— **8 Content Extractors**: YouTube, Twitter, GitHub, PDF, academic papers, RSS feeds, and more
âš¡ **Developer Experience**: 25+ fluent query methods, full type hints, async support, rich CLI tools

## Real Impact for Professionals

Whether you're in **project management**, **academic research**, **software development**, or **knowledge work** - this library transforms how you interact with your Logseq data programmatically.

```python
# Example: Find all overdue high-priority tasks
client = LogseqClient("/path/to/logseq")
urgent_tasks = client.query().blocks()
    .has_priority(Priority.A)
    .has_deadline()
    .execute()
```

## Why This Matters

Knowledge management is evolving beyond manual note-taking. This library enables:
- **Automated workflow analysis** and productivity insights
- **Intelligent content processing** with AI-powered extractors  
- **Scalable knowledge graph analytics** for teams and researchers
- **Seamless integration** between Logseq and Python data science workflows
