## üöÄ Release Process

### Step 1: Environment Setup

```bash
# Install build tools
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel build twine

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e .[dev,test,cli,pipeline]
```

### Step 2: Pre-Release Testing

```bash
# Run full test suite
python -m pytest tests/ -v --cov=logseq_py

# Test CLI functionality
python -m logseq_py.cli --help

# Test package installation
pip install -e .
logseq-py --version
```

### Step 3: Build Package

```bash
# Clean previous builds
rm -rf build/ dist/ *.egg-info/

# Build package
python -m build
```

Expected output files:
- `dist/logseq_python-1.0.0a1.tar.gz` (source distribution)  
- `dist/logseq_python-1.0.0a1-py3-none-any.whl` (wheel)

### Step 4: Package Validation

```bash
# Check package integrity
python -m twine check dist/*

# Test installation from built package
pip install dist/logseq_python-1.0.0a1-py3-none-any.whl
```

### Step 5: TestPyPI Upload (Recommended)

```bash
# Upload to TestPyPI first
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Test installation from TestPyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ logseq-python==1.0.0a1
```

### Step 6: PyPI Upload

```bash
# Upload to production PyPI
python -m twine upload dist/*

# Verify installation from PyPI
pip install logseq-python==1.0.0a1
```

## üîß Automated Release

Use the automated release script:

```bash
# Run automated release process
python scripts/release.py
```

This script will:
1. Clean previous builds
2. Run tests
3. Check code quality
4. Build package
5. Validate package
6. Provide upload commands
