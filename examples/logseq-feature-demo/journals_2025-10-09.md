# Thursday Deep Work - October 09, 2025
- ## Focus Time Block üéØ
- **9:00 AM - 12:00 PM: Uninterrupted Development**
- Implemented complete shopping cart component
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Written 15 unit tests with 95% coverage
- Performance optimized with React.memo and useMemo
- ## Code Quality Session
- ```typescript
  // Refactored complex component into smaller, reusable pieces
  interface CartItemProps {
    item: CartItem;  
    onUpdateQuantity: (id: string, quantity: number) => void;  
    onRemove: (id: string) => void;  
  }
  const CartItem: React.FC<CartItemProps> = React.memo((props) => {
    // Clean, focused component logic  
  });
  ```
- ## Problem Solving üß†
- **Challenge**: Complex state management in checkout flow
- **Solution**: Implemented state machine pattern with XState
- **Result**: More predictable state transitions, easier testing
- ## Technical Learning
- Mastered advanced TypeScript generics
- Explored React 18 Suspense boundaries
- Investigated Web Assembly for performance-critical operations
- ## Accomplishments ‚úÖ
- [#A] DONE Shopping cart component with full functionality
- [#A] DONE Comprehensive test suite implementation
- [#B] DONE Code refactoring for better maintainability
- [#B] TODO Performance audit and optimization
- ## Reflection
- Deep work sessions are incredibly productive. Should block more time like this.
- ## Energy Level: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (flow state achieved!)
