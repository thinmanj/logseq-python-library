- # Logseq Learning Resources
- Comprehensive learning materials for mastering Logseq at all levels.
- ## Getting Started Guide
- ### Basic Concepts
- **Blocks and Pages**
	Everything is a block in Logseq
	Pages are collections of related blocks
	Blocks can be nested and linked
- **Linking System**
	`[[Page Links]]` connect related ideas
	`((Block References))` link to specific blocks
	`#tags` categorize and group content
- **Properties and Metadata**
	Properties enable queries and automation
	Consistent property use improves searchability
- ### First Steps Checklist
- [ ] Create your first page with [[Welcome to My Logseq]]
- [ ] Add some blocks with different content types
- [ ] Try linking to other pages with [[double brackets]]
