- # Page Properties and Metadata
- This page demonstrates how to use properties and metadata effectively in Logseq.
- ## What Are Page Properties?
- Page properties are key-value pairs that provide metadata about a page. They appear at the top of the page and can be used for:
- Organization and categorization
- Filtering and querying
- Automation and workflows
- Cross-references and relationships
- ## Common Property Types
- ### Basic Properties
- ```
- ```
- ### Categorization Properties
- ```
- ```
- ### Project Management Properties
- ```
- ```
- ### Academic/Research Properties
- ```
- ```
- ## Property Usage Examples
- See these example pages with different property configurations:
- [[Meeting: Weekly Standup]] - Meeting page with attendees and agenda
- [[Project: E-commerce Platform]] - Project page with timeline and budget
- [[Person: Alice Johnson]] - Person page with contact and role information
- [[Book: The Pragmatic Programmer]] - Book page with author and reading status
- [[Course: Machine Learning Basics]] - Course page with syllabus and progress
- ## Property-Based Queries
- ### Find all high priority items
- {{query (property priority high)}}
- ### Find active projects
- {{query (and (property type project) (property status active))}}
- ### Find meeting notes from this month
- {{query (and (property type meeting) (between -30d today))}}
- ### Find items assigned to specific person
- {{query (property assigned [[Alice]])}}
- ## Advanced Property Techniques
- ### Multi-value Properties
- ```
- ```
- ### Date Properties
- ```
- ```
- ### Linked Properties
- ```
- ```
- ## Property Best Practices
- ### 1. Consistent Naming
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `start-date` not `Start Date`
- Be consistent across similar pages
- Create a property naming convention
- ### 2. Standardized Values
- Avoid free-form text when possible
- Create enum-like property values
- ### 3. Meaningful Relationships
- Use consistent linking patterns
- Create bidirectional relationships
- ### 4. Query-Friendly Structure
- Design properties for filtering and searching
- Think about how you'll want to query the data
- Use consistent date formats
