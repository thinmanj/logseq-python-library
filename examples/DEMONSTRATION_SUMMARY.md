## 🔍 Technical Highlights

### Sophisticated Parsing
```python
# Example: Multi-dimensional content analysis
content_insights = {
    'task_patterns': analyze_task_patterns(content),
    'knowledge_network': analyze_knowledge_network(content),
    'content_quality': analyze_content_quality(content),
    'temporal_patterns': analyze_temporal_patterns(content)
}
```

### Intelligent Content Generation
```python
# Example: Context-aware content creation
if insights['task_patterns']['completion_rate'] < 0.7:
    generate_productivity_guide(insights['task_patterns'])

if len(insights['knowledge_network']['isolated_pages']) > 2:
    generate_integration_guide(insights['knowledge_network'])
```

### Dynamic Analytics
```python
# Example: Quality scoring algorithm
def calculate_content_depth(page_data):
    score = min(page_data['word_count'] / 100, 10)  # Word contribution
    score += len(page_data['headings']) * 2          # Structure bonus
    score += len(page_data['links'])                 # Connection bonus
    score += len(page_data['code_blocks']) * 3       # Technical bonus
    return score
```
