# Comprehensive Processor Improvements

## Summary
Made significant improvements to the Logseq content processor for videos, X/Twitter posts, and PDFs.

## Changes Made

### 1. Block Structure Fix ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Previously, all metadata was inline in the main block.

**Solution**: Changed to proper Logseq hierarchy:
- **Main block**: Contains the `{{video URL}}`, `{{tweet URL}}`, or `{{pdf URL}}` wrapper with topic properties
- **Sub-blocks**: Contain metadata (title, author, duration, etc.) as indented child blocks

**Example Output**:
```markdown
topic-1:: machine-learning
topic-2:: python
topic-3:: tutorial
- {{video https://youtube.com/watch?v=...}}

### 2. Improved Topic Extraction üöÄ
**Problem**: Topic extraction was basic and produced generic/useless tags.

**Solution**: Implemented advanced NLP-based topic extraction with multiple methods:

#### New Extraction Methods:
1. **Multi-word Phrase Extraction**
   - Extracts bigrams (e.g., "machine-learning", "data-science")
   - Extracts trigrams (e.g., "deep-learning-neural")
   - Recognizes domain-specific terms (machine learning, data science, etc.)

2. **TF-IDF Scoring**
   - Uses term frequency with intelligent scoring
   - Identifies important words based on frequency and context
   - Filters out overly common terms

3. **Title-specific Extraction**
   - Gives extra weight to topics found in titles
   - Extracts capitalized words (proper nouns)
   - Identifies quoted or specially formatted terms

4. **Advanced Ranking Algorithm**
   - Scores topics based on:
     - Frequency in content (2x weight)
     - Presence in title (10x bonus)
     - Category matching (5x bonus)
     - Multi-word specificity (2x per word)
     - Domain term recognition (8x bonus)
     - Technical term patterns (+2 bonus)
   - Filters duplicates and low-scoring topics
   - Avoids near-duplicates (e.g., "learning" vs "machine-learning")

#### Examples of Improved Topics:
**Before**: `video`, `content`, `watch`, `youtube`, `learn`
**After**: `machine-learning`, `python-tutorial`, `data-science`, `deep-learning`, `neural-networks`

### 3. YouTube Transcript Extraction Fix üîß
**Problem**: Transcripts were failing silently for all videos.

**Solution**: Improved error handling and fallback logic:
- Try English transcripts first
- Fall back to any available language
- Try multiple transcript sources
- Better error logging to identify actual issues
- Handle `NoTranscriptFound` and other specific errors gracefully

**New Flow**:
1. Try English transcript directly
2. If not found, try any available transcript
3. If still failing, list all transcripts and pick best available
4. Log specific error types for debugging

### 4. Skip Already Processed Content ‚è≠Ô∏è
**Problem**: Re-running processor would duplicate work and create double-wrapped URLs.

**Solution**: Added intelligent skip logic:
- Check if block already has topic properties (e.g., `topic-1`, `topic-2`)
- Check if URL is already wrapped in `{{...}}`
- Check for any custom wrapper syntax
- Log skipped items for transparency

### 5. Better Content Analysis üìä
**Enhanced Features**:
- Platform-specific extraction (hashtags for Twitter, academic terms for PDFs)
- Multi-language support preparation
- Better handling of long content (truncate tweets to 200 chars)
- Improved metadata display (duration, page count, file size)

## Testing

Run the test script to see topic extraction improvements:
```bash
python test_improvements.py
```

## Usage

Run the comprehensive processor on your Logseq graph:
```bash
python scripts/comprehensive_processor_cli.py /path/to/logseq/graph --max-topics 3 --log-level INFO
```

### Options:
- `--max-topics N`: Maximum number of topics per item (default: 3)
- `--dry-run`: Preview changes without modifying files
- `--no-videos`: Skip video processing
- `--no-twitter`: Skip X/Twitter processing
- `--no-pdfs`: Skip PDF processing
- `--youtube-api-key KEY`: Use YouTube API for better subtitle extraction
- `--twitter-bearer-token TOKEN`: Use Twitter API for enhanced tweet data
- `--log-level LEVEL`: Set logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Hierarchical structure matches Logseq's design
2. **Useful Topics**: Multi-word, specific topics instead of generic single words
3. **Efficient**: Skips already-processed content
4. **Reliable**: Better transcript extraction with fallbacks
5. **Flexible**: Works with or without API keys
6. **Smart**: Context-aware topic extraction based on content type

## Technical Details

### Topic Extraction Algorithm:
- Uses TF-IDF-like scoring for word importance
- Recognizes 20+ domain-specific term patterns
- Weights title content 2x higher than body
- Scores topics on 7 different criteria
- Filters out near-duplicates and low-scoring results

### Block Formatting:
- Main block: URL wrapper + properties
- Child blocks: Metadata (indented with 2 spaces)
- Properties format: `topic-1:: value`
- Compatible with Logseq's native syntax

### Error Handling:
- Graceful degradation when APIs unavailable
- Specific error messages for debugging
- Continues processing even if individual items fail
- Comprehensive error statistics in final report
